      <h2> About me </h2>
      <p>  Hello! My name is Andrew but I mostly go by Co. I am from San Jose, California and am currently a second year student studying my Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering at Santa Clara University.</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p>  Growing up, I always saught interests in creative outlets, project management, and justice-oriented career paths. In high school, I explored creative outlets by picking up photography and digital graphics as a hobby. I created digital flyers for some clubs and was an Outreach Coordinator for a non-profit organization, Interact, where I managed and led community events such as fundraising and volunteering. At that time, I was also interested in the law and how interconnected policies affect societal interactions. With both of my parents being engineers, I naturally geared my future the engineering field as well. Considering my background and interests, I entered Santa Clara University as a Civil Engineering major planning on becoming a Patent Attorney in the future. However, my Silicon Valley roots caught up with me, and after my first Arduino Robot project, I firmly believed the computer science industry was the right path for me. </p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p>
        Attending LA Hacks 2018 reassured me of this decision. Within 36 hours, my partner and I, who were rudimentary programmers, created a website from scratch that integrated the Google Maps and Twilio APIs. The creativity, teamwork, and problem-solving strategies put into the project kindled my passion for the endless possibilities that the computer science world has to offer. 
I am planning on creating more side-projects in free time to expand my interests and curiosity in this industry. 
      </p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p>
        In terms of academics, I am planning on graduating Santa Clara University with a B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering by June 2019, focusing on back-end software development. I am also planning on receiving my M.S. in Software Engineering by June 2020 from Santa Clara University, focusing on Data Analysis and Machine Learning. Currently, in my free time, I am self-learning front-end development, as well as various frameworks for Full-Stack Development. 
      </p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p>I love meeting and working with people, so please feel free to contact me at a17nguyen@scu.edu for more information.
